This uses python-xlib and python-dbus to allow the gnome shell to be zoomed
like enhanced zoom desktop in compiz using the alt, ctrl or shift modifier and mouse scrollwheel
Once zoomed in the combination of modifier+right-mouse-button zooms back out instantaneously.

Besides (for installing via sudo make install) it apparently needs libvala-0.14-0 valac valac-0.14 dconf-editor (dconf-tools)

To select the modifier key use dconf-editor and navigate to:

com->tobiasquinn.com->mousewheelzoom->modifier-key

Note: mousewheelzoom needs to be restarted after a configuration change for it to take effect
Note: config only works with the precise and quantal builds (master branch)




For an easy install use the following instructions - gets you the original program by Tobias Quinn - i.e. no instantaneous zoom out:


There is an archlinux PKGBUILD provided (available from AUR as gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom-git)
